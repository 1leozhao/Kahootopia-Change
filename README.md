### Setup Instructions: 
1. Clone the repo.

   git clone https://github.com/1leozhao/Kahootopia-Change

3. Start the backend server:
   ```

### Reflection:
I liked making this program, it took me a little more than 5 hours to try and make it as close to actual Kahoot as possible. I used React for the frontend, and also incorporated the Material-UI component library. I used node.js for the backend. I took sound effects from Kahoot, Khan Academy, and Toontown Rewritten.
