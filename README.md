### Kahootopia! - A geography trivia game based off of Kahoot!

### Requirements - React, Node.js, npm, Material-UI, Axios, TypeScript. In terminal, cd to geographygame/geography-trivia/server and run command in terminal to start the backend server - 'node server.js'. In terminal, cd to geographygame/geography-trivia and run command in terminal to start the frontend development server - 'npm start'. You can play the game in any browser - 'localhost:3000'

### Reflection: I liked making this program, it took me a little more than 5 hours. I used React for the frontend, and also incorporated the Material-UI component library. I used node.js for the backend.
### I took sound effects from Kahoot, Khan Academy, and Toontown Rewritten.
